This is a google app engine project that has a maps key for localhost:8001
and another for raamapable.appspot.com. The code autodetects where it is
being served from and is supposed to choose the write key.

If you are on OS X and have the GoogleAppEngineLauncher mac app, you can
point it at this directory et voila.
